# A Behat+Mink Demo

## Mink

Mink is a browser emulators abstraction layer.

It defines a basic API through which you can talk with specific browser emulator libraries.

Mink drivers define a bridge between Mink and those libraries.

Read [this article](http://www.knplabs.com/en/blog/one-mink-to-rule-them-all) to know more about Mink.

**This repository will allow you to easily try Mink and Behat to testâ€¦ wikipedia.org!**

## Installation

### Requirements:

You need a valid PHPUnit 3.6 installation:

``` bash
pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear channel-discover components.ez.no
pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com

pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
```

Also, you'll need to install Sahi if you want to test your website in a real browser.
Download the Sahi jar from the [http://sahi.co.in/w/](Sahi website)

### Usage 

Clone this repo:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/knplabs/mink-demo
```

Launch sahi

``` bash
cd $YOUR_PATH_TO_SAHI/bin
./sahi.sh
```

Launch Behat: the two first scenarios should use Goutte.
The third one checks that the JS autocomplete field works on wikipedia: it uses Sahi!

``` bash
php behat-2.0.0RC1.phar
```

You should see an output like:

``` gherkin
